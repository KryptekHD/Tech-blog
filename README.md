# Tech-blog

## Description
    the purpose of this project was to create a place where people could talk about tech wheater they had a question or the just wanted to say something cool that the came across. the project requires for you to create a account that then allows for you to comment on peoples post or create posts that you want other to see. durring the process of this project there were many challenges that I had to face. one of these challenges was creating post and delete routs, there were many little thing that kept throwing me off that lead to me goin in circles at different points. Although there were pasrts that werent that easy over all this website offers up a great place for people to post tech content that they want to talk about and communicate with others.

## Instillation
    there isn't anything that youll need to install if your using the deployed webpage, but if you are not then you'll need to install all of the packages that are in the package.json file along with have Mysql installed in order to hold the data that is created into an api.

## Usage
    in order to use this program you are going to need to create an account on the webpage, because if not then you will only be able to see others posts and you will not be able to comment or create posts. once you create an account you will then be able to scroll through the post and comment on them. along with this you will then be able to navigate to your own profile where you can then create a post for everyone to see.
        if you are going to use this and not use the deployed webpage then you will need to create a .env file to hold your sql password
